title: Hello üëãüèΩ

I am presently a Software Development Manager and [Bar Raiser](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/amazon-bar-raiser) at AWS. Me and my team work on [AWS Cost Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/what-is-costmanagement.html) services. I write about my learnings in delivering and operating software, AWS, and about engineering culture that energizes customer focused delivery everyday.

I like simplicity in software and in things outside of work. I try to be intentional in building [primitives](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-2023-letter-to-shareholders#:~:text=%E2%80%9CPrimitives%20are%20the,freedom%20and%20innovation.%E2%80%9D).
