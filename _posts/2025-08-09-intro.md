During interviews at Amazon, please feel free to use AI. Using AI to generate code isn't going to disbar you from potential employment. Inability to reason about the code you wrote will. That is what most candidates I have spoken with get wrong. 

Within Amazon, we utilize [Cline](https://docs.cline.bot/getting-started/for-new-coders), [Amazon Q](https://aws.amazon.com/q/), and other in-house coding assistant tools regularly to help us with rote tasks such as build failures, resolve gnarly transitive dependencies, write tests. Prompting your favorite coding assistants, copying, and pasting are the easy part. Reasoning about the correctness of the code that got spit out is where the new engineering challenge is.

If you are able to use coding assistants and verify the code for contextual correctness, then by all means use it in your coding interviews. I would prefer if a candidate is transparent about their use of coding assistants and explain their code, than trying to obfuscate it.
